#### Post Processing ####

The aim of the project is to create a post processing extension to the 3D engine [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
You will be able to create render texture, load shaders from the library or add your own shader, manage the render pipeline and display each shader texture for debugging.


### Usage ###

Look at the code example.
